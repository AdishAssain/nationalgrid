Challenge Three: Energy supply solutions during extreme weather events

Company: National Grid

Presenter: Jonathan Barcroft

National Grid ESO is responsible for reliable, secure system operation to deliver electricity when customers need it. We make sure that Great Britain has the essential energy it needs by ensuring supply meets demand every second of every day.

Under guidance of Chris Budd, I (Adish) modelled a simple two-node model demonstrating how topology can play a role in resilience against power demand shocks.
